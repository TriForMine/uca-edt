# UCA EDT

A website for UCA (Université Côte d'Azur)'s students, that shows their schedule from their student id.

## Why?
Because the university doesn't provide any official website to see your schedule, they only send us an excel file.

## How?
We parse the file that they send to us, and import it into a database with our own system.

## Do you collect any data?
No, we don't collect any data. We only get the corresponding schedule from the database from the provided student number.

## Can I contribute?
Contribution is welcome, be sure to follow [Contributor Covenant Code Of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
